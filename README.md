# amppd-ui
amppd-ui is the front-end component of AMP. It provides the online graphical user interface for end users, and communicates with AMP backend by sending user requests to and receiving responses from the server and presenting the results to the user. 

AMP UI is built as a single-page web application with VueJS. To install, config, run AMPPD-UI, as well as contribute to the AMP project, please refer to the instructions on [AMP Bootstrap](https://github.com/AudiovisualMetadataPlatform/amp_bootstrap)
